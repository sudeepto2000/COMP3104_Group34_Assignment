DevOps plays a crucial role in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) by improving collaboration between development and operations teams, reducing time to market, and enhancing software quality.
By integrating DevOps practices into the SDLC, organizations can automate processes, improve efficiency, and ensure faster delivery of features and updates. It also helps in continuous monitoring and feedback, ensuring a more reliable product.
Implementing DevOps in SDLC allows for continuous testing, integration, and delivery, helping to quickly identify issues, reduce downtime, and ensure high-quality releases.
